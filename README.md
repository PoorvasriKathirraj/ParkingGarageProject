This project is a Parking Garage Management System developed in Java. It allows managing parking lots, spots, vehicles, tickets, payments, and exits via a console interface. 
The system issues tickets, calculates fees based on parking duration and tariff, prevents double allocation of spots, and shows current occupancy. 
It is menu-driven and demonstrates object-oriented principles like encapsulation, aggregation, and exception handling.
